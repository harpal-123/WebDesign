     Inline CSS
    <h1>
    <p style="color:green; font-size:22px;">
      This is the simplest way to attach style to the HTML tag - just include a style attribute with the tag along with a list of properties & their values.
    <p/>&nbsp;
	<h1 style="color:blue; font-size:30px;">
     Disadvantages of Inline CSS:
    <h1>
	<p style="color:blue; font-size:14px;">
	  You cannot use quotations within inline CSS. If you use quotations the browser will interpret this as an end of your style value.
	  <br>
	  These styles cannot be reused anywhere else.
	  <br>
      These styles are tough to be edited because they are not stored at a single place.
